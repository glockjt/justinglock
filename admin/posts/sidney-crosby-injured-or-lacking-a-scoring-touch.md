<p>Sidney Crosby has gone 10 consecutive playoff games without a goal. This is the longest goal-scoring drought of his post-season career. Something is clearly wrong. He must be injured, right? But if that's the case, why hasn't Crosby missed practice since the start of the playoffs?</p>

<p>For the majority of his career, we've been accustomed to Crosby bulldozing his way to the net and scoring dirty goals. We've seen Crosby use his wide base and tree-trunk legs to shield off defenders and dominate puck possession. But we've yet to see him do any of this in the post-season. Instead, Crosby has played around the perimeter of the ice. It's not often we've seen him within a stick's length of Sergei Bobrovsky.</p>

<p>Crosby ranks third on the team with 18 shots on goal, but very few of these shot attempts have threatened to cross the goal-line. Some critics think that Crosby is lacking goal-scoring confidence. But I don't buy it. Crosby knows what he needs to do in order to increase his scoring chances, but he's refused to adjust his game. That's why I believe that Crosby is injured.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://triblive.com/sports/penguins/6002635-74/crosby-penguins-bylsma#axzz30H8Ruicm" target="_blank">Rob Rossi of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review</a>, "Crosby appeared to favor his foot after making a turn during the Penguins' home loss to Columbus in Game 2. Also, he missed two of the Penguins' final four regular-season games because of what the team termed an upper-body injury."</p>

<p>When asked if Crosby was healthy, head coach Dan Bylsma didn't make an excuse for his team captain. "He's like everyone else: healthy and ready to go."</p>

<p>If Crosby is playing without an injury, he's playing some of the worst hockey of his career. Only once in nine seasons has Crosby gone longer than 10 games without recording a goal. In 2011-12, he had a 12-game goalless streak. This streak began in his second game back after he missed 10 months due to his famous concussion.</p>

<p>Crosby had a chance to end his goal-scoring drought in Game 5. Unfortunately, he missed an empty net that would've sealed the victory for the Penguins. This may have been the moment when Crosby broke out of his slump, but his goal total remains at zero. He joked about it after the game, but if the Penguins don't escape this series, Crosby will be criticized for his lack of goal-scoring.</p>

<p>"I guess that I didn't want that one," Crosby joked. "It's not like it's been that long, right? It's not as easy as it looks, I guess."</p>

<p>"I thought I had some good chances." Crosby said. "You really have to work to get to the front of the net. Getting six shots is good and [I'll have to] trust that they will go in."</p>

<p>Crosby also ranks 20th in plus-minus rating (-3) out of 21 Pittsburgh Penguins' players who've suited up against the Columbus Blue Jackets in round one of this playoff series. His line-mate, Chris Kunitz ranks last on the team with a -4 plus-minus rating.</p>
